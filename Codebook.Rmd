This codebook is based on the original file `features_info.txt` of the
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). I
have edited the feature list to contain only the variables that are available in my tidy
dataset.

The tidy dataset summarizes the original dataset by combining the train and test datasets,
and grouping and averaging the features for each subject (30 people) and each type of
activity ("WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING",
"LAYING"). For each pair of subject and activity, the tidy dataset has 79 variables that
are a subset of the variables in the original dataset.

The features in the original data sets are described in file `features_info.txt` as follows:

    The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope
    3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to
    denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using
    a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of
    20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body
    and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low
    pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

    Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time
    to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of
    these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag,
    tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

    Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing
    fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag,
    fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

    These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
    '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

    tBodyAcc-XYZ
    tGravityAcc-XYZ
    tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
    tBodyGyro-XYZ
    tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
    tBodyAccMag
    tGravityAccMag
    tBodyAccJerkMag
    tBodyGyroMag
    tBodyGyroJerkMag
    fBodyAcc-XYZ
    fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
    fBodyGyro-XYZ
    fBodyAccMag
    fBodyAccJerkMag
    fBodyGyroMag
    fBodyGyroJerkMag

    ...


In the tidy data set, each pattern `pattern-XYZ` above is represented by six variables:
`pattern-mean()-X`, `pattern-std()-X`, `pattern-mean()-Y`, `pattern-std()-Y`,
`pattern-mean()-Z`, `pattern-std()-Z`. Each pattern without the XYZ ending is represented
by two variables: `pattern-mean()` and `pattern-std()`. There also 13 variables that represent various mean
frequencies.

The values for these variables are computed by combining the train and test datasets, selecting the columns of the
variables from the combined dataset, grouping by `activity` and `subject` and taking the mean for each variable. See
file `run_analysis.R` for details.

The value of each of these variables is normalized and bounded within [-1,1]

In addition the dataset contains variables `activity` and `subject`.
